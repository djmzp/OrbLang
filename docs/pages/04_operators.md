# Operators

Operators allow us to perform calculations on values. There's quite a few of them, most of which will be shown in the following sections.

What you will probably quickly notice is that all of them are written in prefix notation - operators before the arguments. In fact, the entire language uses prefix notation. This relates to fundamentals of how Orb is defined, but this will be explained at a later point in the guide.

For now, try to get accustomed to this syntax. It has a benefit, however - a lot of the operators are variadic. This means they can handle more than two arguments, which can at times allow for shorter code.
