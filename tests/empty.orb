/*
abstract for correctness first, convenience second

if abstracting for convenience, start no sooner then after you wrote the third occurence

avoid maintaining separate, but equivalent representations of data or behaviour

clean architecture is paramount, clean code is helpful

let theoretical principles underline the meaning of your code, but not its actual structure

don't fear for complexity, it will come on its own
